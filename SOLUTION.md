# Solution to Tech Test - Ruby CSV Contact List Processor

See the description of the tech test in the [readme](/README.md).

## Setup of project

The contact list processor project uses the following Ruby libraries:

- `csv` for processing files in CSV format
- `rspec` for testing the contact list processor classes and methods

Before starting work on the code the project was set up with the following:

- `.ruby-version` file to specify the version of Ruby used
- `Gemfile` with the `csv` and `rspec` libraries included in it
- `app` folder for the contact list processor's application files
- `spec` folder for the automated tests
- `spec/fixtures` for files to test the input CSV data and expected output CSV data
